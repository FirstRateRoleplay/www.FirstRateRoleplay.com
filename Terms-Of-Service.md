## (1) Membership Requirements
### 1.01: Age Requirement
The minimum age requirement to join First Rate Roleplay™ is eighteen (18) years of age or older. This is to ensure that all community members maintain a professional and mature environment, and that all community members are adults.  
### 1.02: Member Maturity
Maturity is a key trait that all members of our community must possess. All community members must act maturely at all times when both in-game or interacting with other members of the community through the First Rate RP Discord or Teamspeak servers. 

### 1.03: Following Community Guidelines
All members of our community are expected to adhere to all of the First Rate Roleplay™ Rules, Regulations, and other Department Specific policies as they are written for as long as they are a member of the community. There are no exceptions to violating any of the written guidelines. Not knowing the rules and guidelines is not a valid excuse. 

### 1.04: Leaving the First Rate RP Discord(s)
Candidates who submit an application to join First Rate Roleplay™ but leave the discord server without fully completing the on-boarding process will immediately lose their candidacy to the community, and will be banned from submitting a future application. 	This ban is eligible for appeal if the candidate was in good-standing within the community.  

Active Members who leave the First Rate Roleplay™ Discord Server(s) entirely will be considered Resigned and will no longer hold a position within the community. Members who leave the server(s) will be required to re-apply to regain access to First Rate RP if they decide to re-join the discord at a later date and time after their resignation. 


### 1.05: Expected Activity
To remain a member of First Rate Roleplay™, members must remain active in the community. While we understand that real life and other hobbies will prevent members from playing consistently, we believe that members must maintain a minimum level of activity to ensure they are retaining the guidelines and policies, and staying aware of any changes within the community. Members that become inactive may potentially lose their membership status within the community and have their access permissions revoked. We encourage all members to report extended absences to the community staff/admin team via the #support-tickets channel so that they may be excluded from this calculation.   	

#### 1.05[A]: New Members
Members that join the community and do not connect to the FiveM game server at least once within thirty (30) days of their start date will be identified as inactive and have their membership status removed. These members will be invited to reapply in the future, as long as they are in good standing at the time of departure. 

#### 1.05[B] Existing Members (30 Days)
Members of the community that do not connect to the FiveM game server for longer than thirty (30) days will be marked as inactive on our member tracking system for statistical purposes, and will also receive a message alert to let them know they have been labeled as inactive within the community as a notification.

#### 1.05[C] Existing Members (90 Days)
Members of the community that do not connect to the FiveM game server for longer than ninety (90) days and have not reported a Leave of Absence (LOA) to the community staff/administration via the #support-tickets channel will receive a notification from the FirstRateRoleplay.com#0240 discord bot informing them that they are at-risk of losing their membership status within the community. They will then have a period of seven (7) days to restore their activity within the community otherwise they will have their membership terminated. These members will be eligible to reapply in the future, as long as they are in good standing.  

#### 1.05[D] Probationary Membership
All new members of First Rate Roleplay™ will be subject to a thirty (30) day probationary period. IN the event that a member commits enough offenses to result in a suspension, the First Rate Roleplay™ Staff & Administration may review prior offenses and make a decision to terminate the membership due to the member not being a good fit for the community. 

#### 1.05[E] Membership End
When membership ends, any and all server data (vehicles, characters, properties, etc.) will be permanently deleted from the database within ninety (90) days from the end date of their membership. 

### 1.06: Legally Own Grand Theft Auto V
Owning a legal copy of Grand Theft Auto V (5) through Steam is a requirement for joining First Rate Roleplay™. The member’s game copy must not be pirated or downloaded off of a torrent service (i.e. The Pirate Bay, uTorrent, etc) 

### 1.07: Microphone Requirement
Owning a microphone is a necessity to gameplay within First Rate Roleplay™. Microphones are used to communicate through in-game voice chat which is essential for roleplay scenarios, communication/radio systems, community meetings, etc.

Microphones should be of a decent quality and not have constant background noise(s) or sound like you are yelling through a tin can or wind tunnel, as poor quality microphones can ruin the immersion and cinematic roleplay experience of other members.




## (2) Community Guidelines
### 2.01: Behavior Expectations
#### 2.01[A] Respect
Members of First Rate Roleplay™ are expected to maintain a level of respect for all other members of the community. This is regardless of whether they hold a staff or administrative position or not. There is a zero tolerance policy for disrespecting other members of the community no matter what the circumstances are.

#### 2.01[B] Maturity
All members are required to be mature at all times in all Discord/TeamSpeak channels, as well as during gameplay. Failure to maintain a high level of maturity will result in consequential actions.

#### 2.01[C] Harassment
There is a zero tolerance policy for harassment in this community. This includes, but is not limited to: age, sex, sexual preference, and religion. First Rate RP is an equal-opportunity community. Any members guilty of harassing any other members will be subject to harsh, immediate discipline.

#### 2.01[D] Toxicity
This community is meant to be an entertaining place for all members. Being toxic, such as always having a bad attitude, not performing well, etc., is not good for any members who interact with one who is being toxic. 

#### 2.01[E] Freedom of Speech
This community encourages all members to have their own opinions. For this reason, no member will be disciplined for voicing their opinions as long as it pertains directly to the roleplay community, so long as it is done in a professional manner with constructive criticisms.

#### 2.01[F] Politics & Religion
The discussions of real world politics or religion within the First Rate RP community discord, gameserver, or teamspeak are prohibited. The reasoning behind this is two-fold, one is to prevent unnecessary arguments caused by differing political/religious views, whereas the other is to allow our community to be an escape from the real world. Keep your political and religious values to yourself! 

#### 2.01[G] Staff / Admin Decisions
All decisions made by Staff/Admin members are made for a reason. These decisions should be respected by all members. If there are any concerns regarding a decision that has been made, address it with the Staff/Admin team.

### 2.02: Abuse of Power
Any roles or tags received that grant or contain special permissions are not to be used for unnecessary or unapproved reasons. (i.e. switching members to different channels with no reason or permission, modifying channel information, etc.) 

Changing any information within the Discord / Teamspeak servers and channels is not allowed unless specifically approved by the Executive Management.  

### 2.03: Content Creation
First Rate Roleplay™ does not require members to join any specific roles/positions to be a content creator within our community. Streaming/Recording content is allowed once a member has passed all of their on-boarding and necessary training sessions. 

Training Sessions and Community Meetings are not allowed to be recorded at any time whatsoever, unless permission has been granted by a Staff/Administration member. 

If a member chooses to stream/record, that member owns and responsible for their content, however First Rate Roleplay™ exclusively reserves the rights to utilize any stream/recorded content for server promotion and can repost it on any of the official First Rate Roleplay™ social media page(s) and account(s) at staff discretion. 

Stream sniping is not allowed under any circumstances. If a member is streaming on the server, another member can not watch their stream in order to use it to their advantage during gameplay. Viewing streams is not allowed when you are actively on the server. 

### 2.04: Discord Regulations
Channels should always be kept appropriate, and dialect should remain mature and professional. Channels should only be used for the function it is labeled/needed for. 

Discord servers may contain “Fan” channels, these are for non-members to interact with members of First Rate Roleplay™. Any and all information released in member channels is not to be released in any publicly accessible “fan” channels unless approved by the First Rate RP Staff & Administration Team. 

Members' nicknames for Discord should follow the regulations of the standard for names within First Rate Roleplay™. (As explained in “2.06 Name Display Format”)

Information posted in the Public Safety channels is to remain in those channels only. The same premise applies to Judicial Services channels, and Criminal channels. 

Profile and Banner Photo(s) must be appropriate for a family friendly environment and not be explicit or considered to be Not Safe For Work or offensive to other individuals. .   

All members must be positive, mature, and professional in the Discord server. Any hostile communication or disagreements should be brought to the attention of the First Rate RP Staff & Administration team via the report form in #support-tickets.  

### 2.05: Teamspeak Regulations
Members should ALWAYS be connected to Teamspeak when on the live server
. 
Teamspeak channels are to be used for their named purposes. (Meetings in meeting rooms, RTO in dispatch, civilians in the civilian channel, etc) Members should always double check that they are in the appropriate channel before attempting to communicate with other members as to not disrupt other people’s roleplay.

The TeamSpeak address and server password are NOT allowed to be shared with anybody outside of First Rate Roleplay™, there are no exceptions to this rule. 

Members should ensure their nicknames are saved in their bookmarks to match the appropriate standard of naming as outlined in section “2.06 Name Display Format”

The only sound that should come through a member’s microphone in TeamSpeak is clear communication. No background noises, chewing, music, etc. is allowed! 

### 2.06: Name Display Format
For the First Rate RP Discord, Forums, and TeamSpeak, active members are required to utilize the following format for their nicknames.“Identifier - First ;” or “Identifier -F. Last”
Example: 000 - John D. or 000 - J. Doe

Members are not required to change their Stream profile names to match the format for First Rate RP as long as they ensure they input their accurate active steam screen name into their account settings of the First Rate RP Dashboard / Forum. 

### 2.07: Dual-Clanning Regulations
Here within First Rate Roleplay™, we do not wish to restrict our community members from role playing with their friends in other communities. At the end of the day, we are all adults and can pick and choose where we want to roleplay. However with this in mind, while allowing players the freedom to be in any community they want, we do not wish to provide special permissions or responsibilities to individuals who may or may not be tied down to other responsibilities or obligations within other communities that could have a negative impact on their performance of duties here if they were given elevated roles. 

Therefore if you are in any form of elevated position in another community including but not limited to: FTO/training, on-boarding/recruitment, development, staff/administration, etc. you will be ineligible to obtain any sort of elevated position within our community. 

Additional Policies for Staff & Administration Team Members May Apply (See Handbook) 

### 2.08: Department Applications
In order to be eligible to join the various departments that First Rate Roleplay™ has to offer, you must first be a member for at least thirty (30) days as a civilian before you can apply for any of our public safety agencies. The philosophy of First Rate Roleplay™ is that all members of the community should experience the gameserver and roleplay as a civilian before undertaking and upholding the responsibilities and duties of public safety personnel. At the end of the day, the character(s) you portray in these departments all will have off-duty “civilian” lives of their own at the end of the day. This allows us to gauge your roleplay, and get a feel for your capabilities before granting players special positions. 

In order to apply for one of the whitelisted agencies within the community, visit the #department-applications channel of the First Rate Roleplay™ discord server and create a ticket for the department you wish to apply for, you will be provided on screen prompts with the initial application questions which will then be submitted to the department head for review. You will hear back inside of your ticket with further instructions. 

The available departments that members can apply to join are as follows:
Dispatch 
Fire/EMS 
Judicial Services
Law Enforcement




## (3) Community Structure 
First Rate Roleplay™ is a non-ranked roleplay community. What this means is you do not have to get “promoted” in order to be eligible to perform specific acts or drive certain cars in this community. Every member is treated equally and all has the same permissions on the servers, and everyone is held to the same set of standards and guidelines including our staff team members. 

However, while we are not a "ranked community" we do have a “community structure” designed specifically for community management purposes. 

### 3.01: Management 
The Management team are the executive administrators of First Rate Roleplay™. They oversee and manage the entire community, ensure the bills get paid so the lights stay on, handle all Internal Affairs investigations and reports, and write and approve community policy. They serve as part of the disciplinary committee when necessary,  and hold all the regular duties of your average Staff or Admin. The Management Team has the final verdict in any situation, their word is law surrounding the community as a whole.  

### 3.02: Administration
Administrative Staff members are senior members of the staff team. They have proven themselves to be highly dedicated, and heavily dependable throughout their staff duties and have been promoted by the Executive Management. Admins are eligible to join the Community Affairs, Community Security, & Community Press Divisions. 

### 3.03: Staff Member
The Staff Team are essential members of the community, they dedicate their time helping with Support Tickets, Member Support, Recruitment & On-Boarding, and various other general staff duties to help keep this community afloat. In addition to their general staff duties,  Staff Members are also eligible to apply to become Department Heads and/or Development Personnel (after undergoing a brief test to see if they possess the skills) . 

### 3.04: Staff in Training
Staff in Training are Staff Members that have recently joined the team and are still “earning their wings” and learning the ropes of how things operate behind the scenes. 

### 3.05: Department Head(s)
Department Heads are members of the staff team that have been appointed to serve as the administrative personnel to one of our various departments. Their primary duties are to help develop new policies for their departments and help make this community a more engaging environment. 

### 3.06: Community Volunteer
Community Volunteers are members of the community with a bit of extra time to spare to help out in certain parts of the community. There are various volunteer teams available that members of the community could apply to join by contacting the staff / administration
 - Academy Team (Department FTO’s) 
 - Beta Team (Testing Beta Content) 
 - Membership Team (Application & Interview Review)
 - Mentorship Team (Coaching New Members) 

### 3.07: Community Member
The heart and core of the community itself is with YOU, the community members of First Rate RP. Each member of our community here is equal to one another as we have no “ranks” to win in order to drive a specific car or use certain equipment.

### 3.09: Community Fan
Community Fans are just as valuable as the members themselves! The First Rate Fanbase are phenominal people that hang out in the #fan-chaat of the community Discord server and in the streams of various streamers of our community! Being a fan is the first step to joining the community and eventually leading up to you submitting that application for membership to roleplay with us! 

## (4) Privacy & Security
### 4.01: Personal Information
Any personal information shared (e.g sexual orientation, lifestyle, race, financial status, addresses, etc) is at each member's own risk. First Rate Roleplay™ releases all liability for any information disclosed between other members. First Rate Roleplay™ can not, and will not be responsible for any information released under any circumstances. 

### 4.02: First Rate RP Assets
Any and all assets or information received or obtained from First Rate Roleplay™ is NOT allowed to be shared with any non-members of the community. This includes, but is not limited to, Community Applications, Department Policy Documents, Server Resources, etc. Any unauthorized redistribution of copyrighted intellectual property of First Rate RP can and will result in the necessary legal action being taken for copyright infringement. 

### 4.03: Sensitive Information
Sensitive Information including but not limited to the Gameserver IP Address, the TeamSpeak IP Address, or various other confidential information is forbidden to be shared with non-members without proper authorization from the administration team.  

### 4.04: Discord/TS3 Recording
Recording inside of the First Rate Roleplay™ Discord or TeamSpeak servers is prohibited without prior written approval from the First Rate RP Staff & Administration team. 

### 4.05: Exploitation of Bugs
At no point in time are you to exploit a bug in the server as a benefit to your character or roleplay experience. If you experience a bug in the server, you are expected as a member to file a Bug Report ticket in the #support-tickets channel. If you are caught abusing bugs in the gameserver for your own personal gain, you will be terminated from the community immediately without any prior warning or suspension. There is no excuse for bug abuse! 

### 4.06: Gameserver Hacking
Hacking of any kind on our Gameserver(s) in order to benefit your character stats, or troll others within the community can and will result in immediate termination of membership from the community. This includes but is not limited to: Money Hacks, Health Hacks, Weapon Hacks, Inventory Hacks, Skill/Stat Hacks, Vehicle Hacks/Spawning, etc. 

It is important to note that most actions inside of the gameserver are logged and are accessible by the First Rate Roleplay™ administration team at any time, we see it all!

### 4.07: Rival Server Recruiting
First Rate Roleplay™ is not to be utilized as a recruitment platform under any circumstances! Never attempt to invite a member of First Rate RP to another roleplay community of any kind while an active member of our community, as doing so is not only distasteful and disrespectful to the First Rate RP team, but it clearly violates our regulations and ethical standards. We don’t care if you play on other servers when not playing here, but DO NOT attempt to utilize our community as a means for you to recruit and populate your own community. THIS INCLUDES: direct messaging other members of the community, as well as promoting another roleplay community inside of your Discord Status or About Me section, as it displays within our server to other members. Violation of this policy will result in an immediate termination of your membership and that community being added to our blacklist for violating the privacy & security policy of First Rate RP.

### 4.08: Usage of Unauthorized Crosshairs
First Rate Roleplay™’s gameserver was designed to remove GTA V’s native crosshairs in order to add additional difficulty when aiming and firing weapons. The usage of any form of third party crosshair or aim assist is prohibited and will result in immediate suspension of membership! 


## (5) Roleplay Regulations
### 5.01: Stream Sniping
The use of another streamer’s content for the purposes of stream sniping (using a stream to gather intel on players locations, status, storyline information, etc) is strictly prohibited and is a bannable offense. The act of viewing streams or appearing in the chat of other players streaming First Rate RP while you are also playing on the server is prohibited in order to prevent stream sniping and subsequent metagaming. There is absolutely no tolerance to this rule, and any violations will be dealt with accordingly. 

### 5.02: Metagaming
Metagaming is using external factors, information, or knowledge that your character would/did not obtain through normal in-character means. This includes but is not limited to information gained through live streams, videos, OOC text channels both in-server and in Discord.Utilizing information obtained in a voice chat that your character did not physically obtain is also considered metagaming.Metagaming also includes taking storyline knowledge gained on one character and applying it to another. Alternate characters should have separate storylines and information should not be shared across a player’s characters, as each one is a totally different person at the end of the day. 

### 5.03: Powergaming
Powergaming is an attempt to always maximize one’s ability to “win” in any and all roleplay or gameplay scenarios at the cost of other’s fun and ability to conduct good roleplay or gameplay. Any form of pressind ideas/actions on an individual can be considered powergaming. There must always be options and should never be forced down a single road. This includes but is not limited to; 
Players controlling publicly marked locations - Publicly marked locations are not to be controlled by any player or group. 
Forcing someone to give their vehicle - Making them use /giverkeys, and taking them to a bank to pull out their money while robbing them. 
Never going fully unconscious or not roleplaying injuries when downed.  
Always having a character remember every detail after being downed, always expecting victims to not remember crimes, etc. 

### 5.04: Value of Life
At all times on the server you must value your life and the lives of others. Characters should act according to their personality and mannerisms when faced with a threat to their life, but must overall attempt to preserve their own life and limit the damage done to other lives. Frequent participation in vigilantism, quick drawing/rapid pulling weapons, or other violent/dangerous behavior likely to lead to severe injury or death can possibly be considered failure to value life. If there is ever any confusion the staff/administration is happy to clarify any confusion and give members a definitive answer for whether specific behaviors would be a failure to value life or not if you create a request ticket. 

### 5.06: RDM/VDM
Any killing/murder of an individual without any legitimate roleplay and in character reasoning will be a reportable and actionable offense. This is not GTA/Red Dead Online, this is First Rate RP and we are here to RP not to shoot people or run them down with a car senselessly. All actions should have proper roleplay meaning behind them! 

### 5.07: Fail RP
Fail Roleplay is when you've done something that you wouldn't do in the real world or something that is unrealistic in real life. This includes but is not limited to things such as riding a bicycle headfirst into a building and getting up with no injury, driving a supercar 90+ MPH down a dirt road to evade law enforcement, crashing into another vehicle and driving away like nothing happened, etc. At the end of the day, YES this is a video game, but we are here to roleplay as if the universe we play in is in fact the real world and are to play accordingly and we all join this community for that reason.   

### 5.08: Unrealistic Driving
No Unrealistic Driving You are required to drive realistically when you are in the city. 	There is a great difference between reckless driving and unrealistic driving. Police will handle reckless driving, while First Rate RP Internal Affairs will handle unrealistic driving. 
Examples of Unrealistic Driving Are Including But Not Limited To: 
Jumping your vehicle off of ramps at high speeds and continuing.
Taking a vehicle, not suited for off-road, off-road at high speeds. 
Ramming your vehicle, constantly, into other vehicles with no RP intent

### 5.09: Combat Logging
If you are in an RP situation, you must finish the situation/scenario before you can log out. This includes, but is not limited to, respawning on med if they're actively working on reviving you & respawning in a police situation. If you log out while in active RP it will be looked at as Combat Logging and can result in a disciplinary action.

### 5.10: Quality of RP
We strive to achieve a high quality of roleplay within First Rate Roleplay™. We want our members to be original, creative, but most importantly have fun. However we also expect that all of our members put effort into their roleplay. Constantly taking the “Easy / Lazy RP” approach with the same recycled scenario every day, running from cops on a traffic stop where you would only get a simple citation, constantly robbing or holding players at gunpoint without valid reason. This excessive behavior will result in coaching or could also potentially result in a member being temporarily suspended for a period of time. 

### 5.11: Breaking Character
We get it, sometimes shit happens and we understand. However please do your best to not break character in the server. Breaking character can ruin the immersion for others involved in your scene. If needed you may use the /ooc text command in server to communicate if something is going on (e.g. microphone not working or cannot hear other player).  This command is not meant to be used as a DM! Take your private chats to Discord or Teamspeak! Frequent breaks of character will not be tolerated at all! 

### 5.12: Force RP
First Rate RP defines “Force RP” as using OOC methods evidence that does not exist. For example “/ooc Witness states they saw Mr. X shoot the victim” when Mr. X did not commit this act, forcing the RP onto Mr X’s character. Force RP also includes insisting some else’s character is dead, or should be dead, or intentionally inflicting injuries/taking actions that would leave them with no reasonable way to survive* as should always be their choice.  *(If it is agreed ahead of time with another civilian that this is the purpose of the RP then feel free to disregard this rule - e.g cases such as murder RP, revenge RP, gang war RP, where all parties involved have given their permission.) 

### 5.13: Rage Quitting
Rage Quitting for any reason is not allowed mid-scene. You are required to role-play out the rest of the scene to the best of your ability and may leave and log off the server after the scene has been completed. Rage Quitting not only ruins the experience for others but is also considered Fail RP and toxic behavior. We get it, we are all human and we all get frustrated, but we are also all adults and shouldn’t be throwing temper tantrums. 

### 5.14: In-Game Leadership Policies
Any member of the community that is a designated leader within any in-game entity (e.g. a criminal gang or civilian business) will have higher expectations in communication, gameplay, and rules adherence placed upon them. The First Rate RP Staff & Administration reserves the right to impose these expectations and issue Out of Character (OOC) guidance to in-game leaders due to the nature of server impact that in-game leaders have that can affect ongoing storylines of other members or the community as a whole through their actions or the actions of those affiliated with that specific in-game entity. 

Additionally the First Rate RP Staff & Administration reserve the right to disband any in-game entity and subsequently remove a member from “in-game” leadership of that entity through means of an Administrative Character Action (ACA) if it has been deemed an appropriate action for the community by majority vote of the Staff & Admin team and/or by verdict of the Management or the First Rate RP Community Affairs Division. 

### 5.15: Group Size Limits
 In order for there to be proper balancing and ensure that everything remains fair within the community, the First Rate RP Staff & Administration have imposed various limitations to group sizes for various different player groups as outlined below. 

Over time, as our community size changes, the team will look into the possibility of changing these limitations, however these group size limits will be fully enforced by the staff & administration team henceforth. 
#### 5.15[A] Law Enforcement Group Limits
A maximum of seven (7) Law Enforcement officers are allowed to participate in any melee or firefight in any given scenario without prior staff/administration approval. Approval may be received by creating a scenario approval request ticket in the #support-tickets channel of the First Rate RP community discord server. 

#### 5.15[B] Non-Criminal Group Limits
A maximum of five (5) armed members of any group of non-criminal civilians are allowed to participate in a melee or firefight at one time. A non-criminal is defined as a neutral or law abiding civilian character that has no criminal intent or history, and it is not utilized for criminal activities. 

#### 5.15 [C] Business Size Limits
Businesses are limited to a total of ten (10) players per business at any given time. This counts for both online and offline members of the business and allows for more fair distribution of players as well as helps to alleviate the pressure of constant numbers management for group size. 

#### 5.15[D] Criminal Group Limits
A maximum of five (5) armed members from any group of players with criminal intent or history are allowed to participate in an illegal activity at any given time. Criminals may briefly meet in groups larger than five (5) however should not wander the map or participate in firefights/melees in groups larger than five (5), 

#### 5.15 [E] Gang Size Limits
Criminal Organizations / Gangs are limited to a total of ten (10) players per gang at any given time. This counts for both online and offline members of the gang and allows for more fair distribution of players as well as help alleviate the pressure of constant numbers management for group size.  

### 5.16: Robbery & Heist Rules
 In order for there to be proper balancing and ensure that everything remains fair within the community, the First Rate Roleplay staff and admiistration have implemented various guidelines regarding robberies and heists broken into various sub-sections.  

#### 5.16 [A] Heist Guidelines
During any kind of robbery or heist, all players involved in the illegal activity are considered a Criminal Group and are limited to a maximum of five (5) players within their group as outlined with 5.15[D], with no more than two separate vehicles. This is to ensure that all players have a fair chance in participating in the scene, as well as prevent overwhelming other players. 

Each player may only participate in one (1) bank robbery once every four (4) days, this includes the person initiating the robbery, and the people involved within the active robbery group. You may not rob a bank with a different character during this window of time. Any time the bank doors are breached, it is considered a robbery attempt, regardless of the outcome. 

#### 5.16 [B] Robbing Players
Players are not allowed to take EVERYTHING from another player’s inventory during a robbery or other criminal activity. Players should only take items that are relevant to the situation, and that they realistically would have knowledge of. Remember you are robbing other players! 

## (6) Disciplinary Process
Members who violate any policies in all policy/regulation documents, including SOPs, may be subjected to disciplinary action. This is up to, and including, removal from First Rate RP.

### 6.01: Coaching vs. Suspension
First Rate RP intends to handle most in-game roleplaying problems as improvement/learning opportunities. Therefore, some offenses may only result in a coaching session with a First Rate RP staff member. There are certain offenses, previously mentioned in this handbook, that can result in suspension and even termination from the community, however for smaller offenses and teachable moments we prefer to focus on coaching..

### 6.02: Excessive Offenses
Coaching sessions are not an official disciplinary process. It is simply a chance to have a member redeem themselves to avoid disciplinary action. In cases where a member has been coached multiple times for repetitive issues, that member may be escalated to the process of actual discipline for resolution.

For serious violations like rule violations, disrespecting members, harassment, etc, members will immediately be subject to the official disciplinary process without having a coaching session.

### 6.03: Suspensions
First-time serious offenders face a three (3) day suspension. The second offense will result in a 7-day suspension. The third being a 14-day suspension. The fourth/final offense will result in an immediate termination of membership from First Rate RP..

### 6.04: Immediate Membership Removal
For some offenses that are very serious or extreme, the First Rate RP Administration Team can and will (at their discretion) immediately declare the necessity to terminate membership of an offender with no exceptions if the situation calls for it. 

### 6.05: Disciplinary History Record
Any offenses older than 90 days will not be taken into consideration if a member is subject to disciplinary action, unless otherwise stated by the administration team.

### 6.06: Toxic Member Removal Vote
If a member becomes too toxic for any reason, the First Rate RP staff and administration may take a vote to terminate the member from the community without notice to the member. 

### 6.07: Member Termination Appeals
First Rate RP stands by all decisions made by staff and administration. However, people change. For that reason, 90 days after a member is terminated, the member can submit an appeal by contacting the First Rate RP administration team. The appeal will be reviewed and carefully considered and voted on by the staff/administration before a decision is made. 

In order to file an appeal, compose an email with a written appeal including the following:

### 6.08: Administrative Character Action(s) [ACA]
Administrative Character Action (ACA) is an in-game action or storyline narrative created and enforced by the First Rate RP Staff & Administration Team in the rare and extreme circumstances where there was some form of Disciplinary Action was taken against a notable character, business, or, criminal gang/organization that ultimately resulted in the subsequent shut down and/or removal of that entity from the community. 

The purpose of this “scripted” narrative is to create a lore-friendly and appropriate in-character narrative to the OOC situation in order to prevent heavy impact to on-going storylines with other players that may have been associated with the removed entity in some way, without the narrative having a negative impact on the player(s) involved.
